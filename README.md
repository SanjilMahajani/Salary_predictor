## Data Cleaning

I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

- Parsed numeric data out of salary
- Checked for any duplicates in the dataset

## EDA

I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables also found out outliers
